# Mastering the Proof of Concept
## Tips and tricks for getting Machine Learning projects off the ground

## Summary
While building cloud infrastructure, fraud detection, and risk categorization products, Capital One's Center for Machine Learning has hammered out techniques to keep projects well scoped, on time and devoid of technical debt. During this talk, we'll dive into those techniques, as well as practical tips and tricks.

## Abstract

The Center for Machine Learning at Capital One specializes in developing Proof of Concept (POC) projects that enable us to quickly launch innovative, data-driven projects. Over the course of a 2 month POC, we identify a problem statement and relevant data set, create a set of first pass models, and then iterate on our models based on input from domain experts.

During this talk, we'll cover methods my team has found useful in managing customers, scoping problems and coordinating modeling work.
