## Agile, for Engineers

### Talk Title

Agile, for Engineers

### Brief description

Project management is incredibly useful to keep projects moving and teams happy. It's also a very different mindset than hands on keyboard coding. You'll learn the roles, meetings, and artifacts that comprise Agile development, common implementations, and how to make agile work for you.

### Abstract

Large, complex projects are fulfilling, but also difficult to build. Agile development is a time-honed process for keeping projects moving, and teams happy. 

As a rare software engineer & scrum master, I've learned how to guide engineers through the agile process. Additionally, through my experience leading Machine Learning projects at a large company, I've picked up practical tips and insights that keep teammates challenged & productive.

During this talk, you'll learn the roles, meetings, and artifacts that comprise Agile development, and how to modify agile for your environment. Further, we'll learn how to communicate what you've learned to your fellow engineers, and keep everyone rollin'.
