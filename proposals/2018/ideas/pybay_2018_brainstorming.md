## Proposals

### Proposal Ideas

 - **Forming standards:** Every team creates their own best practices and workflows. What are common tools to create cohesive, robust Python code bases
 - **Software Engineering for Data Scientists:** Data Science projects tend to be harder to scope & more interative. How do we create a helpful workflow for developing data science products?
 - **Deep Learning & data types:** I'm writing a library that can smartly & robustly handle common data types. We'll walk through practical ways of handling these data types, and how to make DL more approachable
 - **Agile, for Engineers:** Project management is incredibly useful to keep projects moving and teams happy. It's also a very different mindset than hands on keyboard coding. We'll work through the roles, meetings, and artifacts that comprise Agile development, and how to make agile work for you.
