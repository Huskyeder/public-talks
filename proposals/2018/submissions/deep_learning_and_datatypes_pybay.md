## Deep Learning & Data Types

### Talk Title

Deep Learning & Data Types

### Brief description

I'm writing a library built on Keras and Pandas that can smartly & robustly handle common data types as deep learning inputs. We'll walk through why categorical, datetime, boolean, and other data types are difficult, practical ways of handling these data types, and how to make DL more approachable. 

### Abstract

Deep learning is a powerful toolset, but I've been frustrated by lack of tools and techniques to pair it with tabular data. In response, I'm building one. 

You'll learn:

 - Why non-numerical data types are difficult for most algorithms (one hot encoding, manual feature extraction, etc)
 - Practical techniques for using categorical, boolean, datetime, and geographic data (with starter code!)
 - How to quickly and efficiently prototype and iterate on deep learning models

Feedback from this talk will also help me create and prioritize features for my work-in-progress package AutoDL, which implements these methods in Pandas and Keras. 

### What attendees will learn

We'll cover how to approach use different data types in Deep Learning, and how to scope and build deep learning projects

### Speaker and talk history

Brendan Herger has given talks at conferences including Strata, PyData, Data Intelligence Conf, Data Day Austin, the Sentiment Analysis Symposium, and others. This is a new talk, covering a work in progress package.
