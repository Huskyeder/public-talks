## Abstract

Getting data formatted and into keras can be tedious, time consuming, and difficult, whether your a veteran or new to Keras. keras-pandas overcomes these issues by (automatically) providing the necessary building blocks, built on state of the art research. 

During this talk, the audience will learn:

 - How to utilize the keras-pandas interface
 - How to handle common data types in neural networks (e.g. training an embedding for categorical variables)
 - How to bring this new skillset into their own projects

## Tags

### Outline

This talk will build on this slide deck, used to get beta feedback: https://github.com/bjherger/public-talks/blob/master/SF-Python-2018/keras-pandas.pdf

The outline will include the following sections:

 - Intro / context
   - XKCD comic
   - Why using DL for tabular data (numeric, categorical, boolean, datetime, etc) is tough
 - Theory (optional)
   - Behind the scenes into best practices for data types
   - References to papers for best in class approaches
 - Hands-on
   - Walk through [titanic example](https://github.com/bjherger/keras-pandas/blob/master/examples/titanic.py)
 - Recap

## Pitch

 - Deep Learning is a powerful tool, with a high barrier to entry. keras-pandas lowers that barrier, and allows more advanced users to iterate much more quickly. 
 - keras-pandas is the 2.0 of a platformed that I designed and built, while building and leading machine learning teams at a Fortune 100 company. It has been the base of multiple efforts including insider thread, fraud detection, and legal fulfillment. 

## Speaker Bio

Brendan brings a unique combination of machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering skills. In his previous work at Capital One and startups,  he has built authorization fraud, insider threat, and legal discovery automation platforms. In each of these cases he's lead a team of data scientists and data engineers to enable and elevate his client's business workflow (and capture some amazing data).

When he's not knee deep in a code base, Brendan can be found traveling, sharing his collection of Japanese teas, and playing board games with his partner in Seattle.
