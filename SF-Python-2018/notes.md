# Outline

Thesis

 - DL is attainable. `keras-pandas` allows users to rapidly build and iterate on deep learning models.

Attention grabber

 - Display keras examples. None involve regular, tabular data

Intro

 - Thesis
   - For noobs: Good starting point, lower barrier to entry
   - For longtime keras users: Allows for rapid iteration, good starting point
 - Agenda



Hands on

 - Describe existing process
   - Highly customizable
   - Involves high amount of domain expertise & heuristics
   - Time consuming & repetitive
 - Walk through getting started w/ KP
   - Rapid build and iterate
   - More consistent code base

Lessons learned from creating a pypi registered project

 - Thank your loved ones
 - Find a few good examples you'd like to borrow (steal) from
 - Stack
   - MD (docs) & RST (docstrings)
   - Sphinx documentation (with m2r plugin for markdown)
   - readthedocs.io serving
   - Travis for CI/CD
