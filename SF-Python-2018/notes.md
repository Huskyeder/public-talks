# Meta

## Audience

 - Familiar with Python
 - Potentinal not familiar w/ Data Science
 - Historically supportive of new projects

## Goals

Thesis

 - DL is attainable. `keras-pandas` allows users to rapidly build and iterate on deep learning models.

Need to have

 - Get people to try out keras-pandas
 - Get feedback
 - Communicate hints for building a project

Nice to have

 - Gain popularity for project
 - Get feature requests / community involvement
 - Drive SEO

TODO before talk

 - Update example
 - Update documentation link
 

## Time

 - 10 minute session
 - Aiming for 5 minute talk

# Outline

Attention grabber

 - Show of hands: Who works in CV or NLP?
 - Show of hands: Who uses pandas / tabular data more regularly?
 - Display keras examples. None involve regular, tabular data

Intro

 - Thesis
   - For noobs: Lowering the barrier to entry, good starting point. 
   - For l33ts: Allows for rapid iteration, good starting point
 - Agenda


Hands on

 - Describe existing process
   - Highly customizable
   - Involves high amount of domain expertise & heuristics
   - Time consuming & repetitive
 - Walk through getting started w/ KP
   - Rapid build and iterate
   - More consistent code base


Call to action

 - Install instructions
 - Point to documentation
